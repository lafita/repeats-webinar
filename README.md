This repository contains the files and scripts used during the webinar.

The [Python script](msa_to_matrix.py) is used to calculate the all-to-all matrix of pairwise sequence identities and the [R script](dup_pattern_plots.R) is used to generate the plots shown in the presentation: [similarity matrix](A0A087WZJ2_dup-pattern.pdf) and [similarity autocorrelation vector](A0A087WZJ2_atocorrelation.pdf).
